# poe

My very own [acme](http://acme.cat-v.org/)-inspired terminal text editor.

Because everything else is Not Invented Here.

## Install

You need [Go](https://golang.org/). Then:

`go get -u github.com/prodhe/poe`

Binary distribution may or not be available. As of now, the source should do just fine.

## Bugs

Endless. As of now, it is in constant development and things may (and will) break unannounced. Do not use for production.
